        This was a groundbreaking part released in the mid 90's which showcased his nonchalant flowing style and ability to perform switch tricks over handrails, which was extremely rare at the time.

    es Menikmati- 2000</h2>

      <td>This 2000 release cam after Penny had created a buzz around himself in the USA before seemingly disappearing. It is in some respects a compilation of his footage from the 90's and cemented his reputation as a legendary figure. </td>

    Flip Sorry- 2002</h2>

  <table bgcolor=grey cellpadding=40>

      </td>
      <td>
        With so much footage in Menikmati having been filmed years prior, Flip Sorry showcased Penny's skating after his move to France. Though Penny's skating itself had not really changed, Flip Sorry was a step forward for
        skateboarding in general, with Penny joining a roster stacked with a who's-who of world class street skateboarders.
